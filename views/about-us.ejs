                    <p>We are a group of web developers who seek a textbook sharing platform that every student can benefit from. Students often purchase textbooks at high prices, but end up leaving them unused on bookshelves for ages. On the other hand, there are people who wish to use a book only for a short period of time and not have to pay full price to buy it. Our idea is to create a site for these users; book holders who are not going to touch their book for a while can lend them out to the others who need it temporaily and also make money in the process.</p>

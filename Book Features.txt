Book Sharing Features
1.	2  Types of Users, Admin and user.  Each user can borrow and share books.  Admin can borrow and share as well
2.	Books: users can upload books and give detail description about genre, course, etc
Each book can only be shared to one person at a time. Needs an unique identifier like ISBN
Assume that the user is correct in entering books.  
3.	The person sharing the book should specify how long they are willing to borrow, and it should be free.
4.	The person borrowing will borrow for the whole duration of the time frame specified by the book owner (For now, more flexibility can be implemented later)
5.	After the person returns the book, he can rate the book and add comments which will be added to the book¡¯s profile (rating the user)
6.	The borrower and the owner can rate their respective owner/borrow after each borrow, leaving comments to be shown in the user¡¯s profile.
7.	Book search can be done based on book name, course code, etc (TBD)
8.	For social networking feature, each user will have an inbox that stores the messages they receive, and they can reply to these messages.  
	We can also flag inboxes for a wrong book entry/bad user or whatever, and the admin will be able to look at the flagged messages.  The admin can only look at regular messages
9.	The admin can delete / edit book entries, this will notify the owner of the book.
